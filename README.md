Deep Learning Advanced image classification using neural networks to improve product recommendations

-------

**Overview**

Using a database of 150,000 data points. The goal was to develop a neural network model that could accurately classify images. I used tools such as Python (TensorFlow, Keras) and deep learning techniques such as data augmentation. I achieved an accuracy of 85.38% on the tested data, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the model.

* Tensorflow: This project used to design and train the neural network model, achieving high accuracy in image classification while efficiently handling the large volume of data.
* Keras: is an API that runs on TensorFlow, which simplifies the process of building deep learning models. It allowed me to quickly prototype the image classification model, test different architectures, and achieve high-performance results with an accuracy of 85.38%. Keras is particularly useful for speeding up development while maintaining robust performance.
* Data augmentation: allowed me to increase the diversity of images for training the model, by applying transformations such as rotating or inverting the images. This method allowed to improve the generalization of the model, thus reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing the accuracy on the tested data.
